_Note_: the quantile regression model is in general nonparametric in the orignal paper. For simplicity, ```semqreg``` only estimates the ***approximating (linear) quantile regression model***. In other words, as long as folks have a linear panel quantile regression with hidden covariates, ```semqreg``` can be invoked.
